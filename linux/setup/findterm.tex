Depending on your distribution of Linux (Ubuntu, Fedora, Red Hat, Gentoo, etc), you will have different defaults for your window managing environment.
Ubuntu, for example, uses the Unity desktop environment, but is often packaged with versions of Gnome as well.
For our purposes, it does not much matter what your distribution, window manager, or favorite kind of hair spray is, but only that you can find the terminal program.

If you use a quick-launch system like Gnome-Do or the Unity search, you should be able to find the terminal by searching for a program named ``Terminal''.
Otherwise, you will probably need to do a menu crawl of some kind, and the Terminal will be listed as an application or utility of some kind.
In the worst case, you should be able to find instructions online for your installation to open the terminal.
We will assume that you are successful in doing so, although different environments will make this task arbitrarily hard or easy.
