Go to Spotlight Search or Applications and find the Terminal app.
Many people prefer the freely available iTerm app, but both will behave the same for our purposes.
Once you have launched the terminal, you will be presented with a command prompt, which is a simple text entry field.
You can now type commands into the terminal, such as \texttt{ls} to list the contents of the current working directory.
Do not worry too much about using the terminal -- we will revisit the commands available there later on.
